In this end-to-end data analytics project, we have used cricket T20 world cup (2022) data to build insights on a best 11 players team. I have used web scraping to collect data from espn cricinfo website then we performed some data transformation & cleaning in pandas, followed by building dashboards in Power BI.

Steps Involved In the Project :-

## 🌐Data Collection and Preprocessing: 
Collected the raw data from the ESPN database and preprocess it using Python. Data cleaning and feature engineering techniques applied to ensure the data is in the desired format for analysis.

## 🧹Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Cleaning: 
Conducted EDA on the preprocessed data using Python. This step includes performing statistical analysis, creating visualizations, and identifying patterns and trends in the data.

## 🪄Export Data to Power BI: 
Exported the preprocessed data and the results of the EDA and modeling steps to Power BI using a suitable file format CSV.

## ⚒️Create the Dashboard: 
In Power BI, created a new report and added visualizations such as tables, charts, and graphs to represent the analyzed data. Used Power BI's drag-and-drop interface to create a dashboard that effectively communicates the insights you have gained from the analysis.

## 📊Publish and Share the Dashboard: 
Once the dashboard is completed, published it to the Power BI service. Users can access the report through the Power BI app or web portal.

This project helped me to learn new features of Power BI.
